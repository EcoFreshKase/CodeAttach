## Implementation ideas

- Chrome extension to convert the code with carbon

  - all files / root file can be selected in GUI
  - all settings can be made in GUI
  - formatting can be done with carbon
    - safes a lot of time
  - all files to convert can be thrown into carbon and converted
    - file path can be preserved by embedding it in the code and converting the image created by carbon to pdf or use the image in a html file and convert that to pdf

- rust cli tectonic application
  - use tectonic to create latex document to later convert to pdf
  - specific formatting can be done with a format latex file
  - no browser needed
